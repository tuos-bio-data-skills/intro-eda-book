# Getting ready to use **dplyr**

## Introduction

Data wrangling is the process of cleaning and manipulating data to get it ready for analysis, for example, by creating derived variables and subsets of the data. Although not the most exciting part of a study---we want to answer questions, not format data---data wrangling is critical. This step in a data analysis workflow can become very time-consuming if not tackled with the right tools.

The next few chapters will introduce the **dplyr** package. **dplyr** is an important member of the tidyverse ecosystem. Its job is to provide a set of tools to address common data manipulation tasks, such as selecting subsets of data, making new variables, and summarising data in various ways.

However, before we can start to use these tools, we need a bit of a foundation. That is the aim of this chapter. We will provide some background to the so-called tidy data principles, introduce the data set we'll be using in our examples, discuss the tidyverse version of data frames known as the tibble, and finally, introduce the **dplyr** package.

## Tidy data

**dplyr** will work with any data frame. However, it is most powerful when data are organised according to [tidy data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) conventions for rectangular data sets. Tidy data has a specific structure that makes it easy to manipulate, model and visualise. A tidy data set is one where each variable is only found in one column and each row contains one unique observation (an imaged cell, a treated organism, an experimental plot, and so on).

The basic principles of tidy data are not too difficult to understand. We'll use an example to illustrate what the "one variable = one column" and "one observation = one row" idea means. Let's return to the made-up experiment investigating the response of communities to fertilizer addition. This time, imagine we had only measured biomass, but that we had measured it at two time points throughout the experiment.

We'll look at two ways to organise some artificial data from this experimental setup. The first uses a separate column for each biomass measurement:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
trt <- rep(c("Control","Fertilser"), each = 3) 
bms1 <- c(284, 328, 291, 956, 954, 685)
bms2 <- c(324, 400, 355, 1197, 1012, 859)
experim.data <- data.frame(Treatment = trt, BiomassT1 = bms1, BiomassT2 = bms2)
experim.data
```

This feels like a reasonable way to store such data, especially for an Excel user. However, this format is **not** **tidy**. Why? The biomass variable has been split across two columns (`BiomassT1` and `BiomassT2`), which means each row corresponds to two distinct observations. We won't go into the 'whys' here but take our word for it---adopting this format makes it difficult to use **dplyr** efficiently.

A tidy version of that example data set would still have three columns but now these would be: `Treatment`, denoting the experimental treatment applied; `Time`, denoting the sampling occasion; and `Biomass`, denoting the biomass measured:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
trt <- rep(c("Control","Fertilser"), each = 3, times = 2) 
stm <- rep(c("T1","T2"), each = 6)
bms <- c(bms1, bms2)
experim.data <- data.frame(Treatment = trt, Time = stm, Biomass = bms)
experim.data
```

The change we made was to create an indicator variable called `Time` for the sampling occasion. In version one of the data, the time information was implicit---the time associated with a biomass measurement was encoded by column membership (`BiomassT1` vs `BiomassT2`). In the second version of the data set an indicator variable, `Time`, was created to label the sampling occasion explicitly. That simple change means each row corresponds to one distinct observation and each variable lives in one column. These data are now tidy and ideally set up for use with **dplyr**.

The best way to make sure your data set is tidy is to store in that format **when it's first collected and recorded**. Some packages can help convert non-tidy data into the tidy data format (e.g. the **tidyr** package), but life is much simpler if we ensure our data are tidy from the very beginning.

## Penguins! 🐧+📊= 😃 {#penguins-data-overview}

To make progress with **dplyr**, we are going to need some data to play around with. The data we'll use contains measurements taken from penguins on the Palmer Archipelago, off the north-western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Each row contains information about an individual penguin, including:

-   the species it belongs to,
-   the island it was found on,
-   morphometric data (flipper length, body mass, bill dimensions)
-   its body mass and sex,
-   and finally, the year of capture.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Meet the Palmer penguins (artwork by Allison Horst)"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/lter_penguins.png")
```

Why use this data set? Apart from the fact that everyone likes penguins, obviously, these data are sufficiently complex to demonstrate everything we want to do, while remaining easily understandable. Here is the full data set shown as a table:

```{r, echo=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
rmarkdown::paged_table(penguins)
```

*N.B. --- the data will only show up in the HTML version of the book.*

This shows the first ten rows along with the first few columns. The *Previous / Next* links at the bottom right can be used to navigate the rows; the arrows in the top header row are used to view the different columns. Below each column name you can also see three-letter abbreviations like `<dbl>`, `<int>` and `<chr>`. These are telling us that each column is a vector of some kind:

-   `<dbl>` = a numeric 'double' vector (real numbers, i.e. with decimals)

-   `<int>` = a numeric integer vector (integer numbers)

-   `<chr>` = character vector.

So... data frames are table-like objects with rows and columns. They can also be seen in even simpler terms---data frames are simply collections of vectors, where each one represents a different aspect of a multi-faceted data set.

We're going to be seeing a lot of this data set in the remaining chapters so we won't say anything more about it now.

#### Where can we get the penguins data? {.unnumbered}

The Palmer penguins data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station](https://pal.lternet.edu/). The data set exists mostly to support people learning and teaching R. It isn't part of base R, though. We have to import it into R somehow. There are two options:

1.  The data are available in an R package called... [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/index.html). Like other packages, **palmerpenguins** can be installed from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/palmerpenguins/index.html) using either `install.packages` or the usual RStudio point-and-click mechanism. Once installed, we can make it available by running `library(palmerpenguins)` in any R session. After that, just type the name of the data set and R will find it and use it. The version in **palmerpenguins** is called `penguins`, by the way.

2.  We could get a copy of the data set and store it as a file on our hard drive, ideally using a standard data format. The most common and portable format for storing rectangular data is as a 'Comma Separated Value' (CSV) text file. Once you have a copy of the data as a CSV file, it's just a matter of using a function like read_csv from the readr package to import the data into R. This is explained in the [Managing projects, scripts and data files](#project-scripts-data) appendix.

## Um... tibbles?

To increase the scope of what the tidyverse can do, its makers created a special kind of data object known as a 'tibble'. This is meant to sound like the word 'table' pronounced by a New Zealander. We're not lying---the person who started the tidyverse is from New Zealand. Its name is a clue that a tibble is a table-like object, i.e. a rectangular data structure similar to a data frame.

In fact, the easiest way to conceptualise a tibble is as a special data frame with a few extra whistles and bells. More often than not, it's not necessary to pay attention to whether we're working with an ordinary data frame or a tidyverse tibble---we can often treat them as though they are interchangeable.

That said, there are exceptions to this rule of thumb, and we do occasionally need to work out which one we're using. A simple way to do this is by printing the data object. Imagine that we've imported the Palmer penguins into R and stored it in a tibble called `penguins`. This is what that would look like if we printed it at the Console:

```{r}
penguins
```

The formatting applied to the output is telling us `penguins` is a tibble rather than an ordinary data frame (we only called it a data frame earlier because we had not introduced the concept of a tibble yet). There are a couple of clues about this in that printout. The very obvious one is the first line: `# A tibble: 344 x 8`. The printed output states `penguins` is a tibble! The output is also truncated---only the first ten lines were printed, and any columns that won't fit on one row are summarised at the bottom (i.e. `sex` and `year`).

## Missing values

Take a close look at the values of the body mass data (`body_mass_g`) in `penguins` (we're using `$` to extract the whole column):

```{r}
penguins$body_mass_g
```

The body mass information lives in a numeric (integer) vector, but not every element in that vector is a number. Two values are `NA`. That stands for 'Not Available'---the `NA`'s job is to label cases where a value is missing or unknown. If you scroll around the table view of `penguins` above you'll find `NA`'s in several of the columns.

Missing data crop up all the time. They are just one of those facts of life---maybe the recording machine broke one afternoon, perhaps one of our organisms was infected by a pathogen, or maybe a cow ate one of our experimental plots. One of the nice things about R is that it knows how to represent missing data. It does this using the `NA` symbol.

You need to be aware of missing values when they are present. Why? Because the behaviour of many functions is affected by the presence of `NA`s. Things get confusing if we don't understand that behaviour. We will see some examples of this in the next few chapters.

## Introducing **dplyr** {#why-dplyr}

The **dplyr** package has been carefully designed to make it easy to manipulate 'rectangular data', such as data frames. **dplyr** is very consistent in the way its functions work. For example, the first argument of the main **dplyr** functions is always an object containing our data. This consistency makes it very easy to get to grips with each of the main **dplyr** functions---it's often possible to understand how one works by seeing one or two examples of its use.

Another reason for using **dplyr** is that it is orientated around a few core functions, each designed to do one thing well. These **dplyr** functions are sometimes referred to as its 'verbs' to reflect the fact that they 'do something' to data. For example:

-   `select` is obtains a subset of variables,
-   `mutate` is constructs new variables,
-   `filter` is obtains a subset of rows,
-   `arrange` is reorders rows, and
-   `summarise` is calculates information about groups.

Notice that the names are chosen to reflect what each verb/function does to the input data. We'll cover each of these verbs in detail in later chapters, as well as a few additional ones, such as `rename` and `group_by`.

Apart from being easy to use, **dplyr** is also fast. This doesn't matter for small data sets but can be important when working with data sets with hundreds of thousands of rows. The **dplyr** package also allows us to work with data stored in different ways, for example, by interacting directly with several database systems. We're going to focus on using it with data frames and tibbles. But remember---once you know how to use **dplyr** with data frames its easy to use it for work with other kinds of data sources.

#### A **dplyr** cheat sheet {.unnumbered}

The developers of RStudio have produced a very usable [cheat sheat](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/) that summarises the main data wrangling tools provided by **dplyr** (find the one called 'Data transformation with dplyr').

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/data-transformation.jpg")
```

Our advice is to download this, print out a copy, and refer to it often as you start working with **dplyr**.

### A first look at **dplyr** {#more-dplyr}

Let's take a preliminary look at the **dplyr** package. The package is not part of the base R installation, so we have to have installed it first. Remember, once installed, there is no need to install the package every time we need to use it. We do have to use `library` to load and attach the package every time we want to use it:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("dplyr")
```

Let's look at one handy **dplyr** function now. Sometimes we just need a quick, compact summary of a data frame or tibble. This is the job of the `glimpse` function from **dplyr**:

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

The function takes one argument: the name of a data frame or tibble. It then tells us how many rows it has, how many columns there are, what these columns are called, and what type of data is associated with them. This function is useful when we need a quick overview of what's inside our data set. Some advice---use this function on any new data set before trying to do anything with it.

### **dplyr** pseudocode

We'll wrap-up this chapter with a quick mention of 'pseudocode'. Pseudocode uses structural conventions of normal R code but is intended for us (humans) to read rather than the computer. We use it summarise how **dplyr** functions work. Here's an example you will encounter in the next chapter:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
select(<data>, <variable-1>, <variable-2>, ...)
```

**This is not an example we can run.** It is pseudocode that serves as a template for using the **dplyr** `select` function. The words surrounded by 'angle brackets' (`< >`) are placeholders. If we want to turn this pseudocode into real R code we have to **replace those placeholders**. For example, `<data>` is a placeholder for the name of a data set. We would replace that with the word `penguins` if we want to use select on our example data set (we'd also have to do something with the other placeholders (e.g. `<variable-1>`)---we'll get to that later).

That's enough about pseudocode and **dplyr** templates. We'll see plenty of these in the next few chapters.
